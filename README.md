# Generative Models
Generative model is a class of models for unsupervised learning where the goal is to generate new samples from the same distribution for given training data.

This repository contains ipython notebooks on the following generative models:
- `autoencoder`
    1. autoencoder_mnist.ipynb : basic implementation of naive autoencoder model in *keras*
    2. variational_mnist.ipynb : implementation of variational autoencoder model using fashion MNIST dataset. Variational autoencoder is a probabilistic autoencoder & generative model.
    
- `Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)`
    1. GAM.ipynb: implementation of GAN, DCGAN models for fashion MNIST dataset
